  - Power users with high spend show different patterns.
  - Time-of-day and device usage influence purchasing frequency.
- Recommended metrics:
  1. Customer conversion rate from registration to first purchase.
  2. Repeat purchase rate over time.
  3. Average order value (AOV).
  4. Churn rate based on inactivity windows.

Check the notebook for full code and the presentation for a high-level summary of insights.
