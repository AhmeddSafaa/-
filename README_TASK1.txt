Task 1 - SQL Challenge

1. Query 1 filters the Users table for registrations in Finland within the last 30 days.
2. Query 2 joins Sales and Purchases to count users who purchased more than one unique product in the last 30 days.
3. Query 3 gives two methods to retrieve the most recent price per product:
   - Method 1 uses window functions (ROW_NUMBER).
   - Method 2 uses a subquery with MAX(Purchase_id).
